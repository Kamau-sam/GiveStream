## Introduction

GIVE STREAM is a platform dedicated to encouraging repeat donations to charities that focus on providing essential services such as sanitary towels, clean water, and sanitation facilities to school-going girls in Sub-Saharan countries. Our goal is to streamline the donation process, provide transparency, and create an engaging platform for donors and charities alike.

## Problem Statement
